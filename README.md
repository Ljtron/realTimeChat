# RTC (RealTime chat)

## Description

The project I made called RTC is a node js web app that allows two or more users to communicate through instantaneous chat. The technology used in this web app is express js which is used for the website so you can get a webpage when you put the address in the browser. I also used socket.io which gives the app the ability to communicate through bidirectional connections. Bidirectional connection is primarly used for chat apps because it allows you to recieve and see messages without having to reload the webpage every time a message is sent to the reciever.

## Screenshots

The two images that you are seeing is a text message between two people using the web app.
